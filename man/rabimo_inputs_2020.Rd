\subsection{\code{rabimo_inputs_2020}}{

A list containing two elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{data}}{a data frame with the input data to R-Abimo (see below)}

\item{\code{total_area}}{Total block area in square metres (numeric)}
\item{\code{main_frac}}{Fraction of the total area that is NOT considered as "road" area (numeric value between 0.0 and 1.0). This value should be 0.0 if roads are modelled separately, i.e. as block areas on their own.}

\item{\code{green_roof}}{Fraction of the roof area that belongs to green roofs (numeric value between 0.0 and 1.0). A value of 1.0 means that all roofs in the block area are green roofs.}
\item{\code{swg_roof}}{Fraction of the roof area that is connected to the drainage system (numeric value between 0.0 and 1.0)}
\item{\code{pvd}}{Fraction of the total block area that is paved (numeric value between 0.0 and 1.0)}

\item{\code{srf4_pvd}}{Fraction of the paved area that belongs to surface class 4 (numeric value between 0.0 and 1.0, see note 1 below)}
\item{\code{srf5_pvd}}{Fraction of the paved area that belongs to surface class 5 (numeric value between 0.0 and 1.0, see note 1 below)}
\item{\code{road_frac}}{Fraction of the total area that is considered as "road" area (numeric value between 0.0 and 1.0)}
\item{\code{pvd_r}}{Fraction of road area (within the block area) that is paved (numeric, see note 2 below)}
\item{\code{swg_pvd_r}}{Fraction of paved road area (within the block area) that is connected to the drainage system (numeric, see note 2 below))}
\item{\code{srf1_pvd_r}}{Fraction of paved road area (within the block area) that belongs to surface class 1 (numeric, see note 2 below))}
\item{\code{srf2_pvd_r}}{Fraction of paved road area (within the block area) that belongs to surface class 2 (numeric, see note 2 below))}
\item{\code{srf3_pvd_r}}{Fraction of paved road area (within the block area) that belongs to surface class 3 (numeric, see note 2 below))}
\item{\code{srf4_pvd_r}}{Fraction of paved road area (within the block area) that belongs to surface class 4 (numeric, see note 2 below))}

\item{\code{ufc30}}{field capacity in 30 cm depth (numeric)}
\item{\code{ufc150}}{field capacity in 150 cm depth (numeric)}
\item{\code{land_type}}{land type, one of \code{forested}, \code{horticultural}, \code{urban}, \code{vegetationless}, \code{waterbody} (character)}
\item{\code{veg_class}}{vegetation class (numeric values each being one of 0, 1, 10, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55). Each combination of block and land use type is assigned to a distinct vegetation class value.}
\item{\code{irrigation}}{irrigation in mm per year (integer)}
\item{\code{block_type}}{Block type identifier of the form "usage-type-id_block-type-id_usage-type-description_block-type-description" (character)}
}

Note 1: The sum of surface class fractions \code{srf1_pvd}, \code{srf2_pvd}, \code{srf3_pvd}, \code{srf4_pvd}, \code{srf5_pvd} should be 1.0 within each block area. For the meaning of the five different surface classes in Berlin, see the table in the Details section below.

Note 2: The fields with suffix "_r" are all zero because rows are modelled as their own blocks. In an earlier version of the dataset, roads were modelled as parts of the block area.

\subsection{\code{rabimo_inputs_2020$config}}{

A list with 5 named elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{runoff_factors}}{Runoff factors for roofs and five different surface
types, given as a vector of numeric with element names \code{roof}, \code{surface1},
\code{surface2}, \code{surface3}, \code{surface4}, \code{surface5}. A runoff factor determines
the proportion of precipitation that, after subtraction of
evapotranspiration, becomes surface runoff from a paved area. The higher
the factor, the less permeable is the surface. See the table in the Details section below.}
\item{\code{bagrov_values}}{Bagrov values to calculate evapotranspiration from
paved surfaces, given as a vector of numeric with element names \code{roof},
\code{green_roof}, \code{surface1}, \code{surface2}, \code{surface3}, \code{surface4}, \code{surface5}.
The higher the Bagrov value, the more evapotranspiration is generated by
the model, see the table in the Details section below. For a description of the evapotranspiration model and for a
figure that shows the influence of the Bagrov values (n) on the
evapotranspiration (in German), see \url{https://www.berlin.de/umweltatlas/wasser/wasserhaushalt/2001/methode/}}
\item{\code{result_digits}}{relict of the original ABIMO model, not used in R-Abimo!}
\item{\code{irrigation_to_zero}}{relict of the original ABIMO model, not used in R-Abimo!}
\item{\code{swale}}{Model parameter(s) related to the 'swale' measure, given as a
vector of numeric with currently one value, named
\code{swale_evaporation_factor}. The swale evaporation factor determines which
fraction of the water going into a swale becomes evapotranspiration (the
rest becomes infiltration).}
